# LokeshReddy
This is Lokesh Reddy from Dell Technologies. I started picking up Infrastructure as Code automation.
I have taken the responsibility of enabling customers and our pre sales engineers with automation efforts.

As part of this, I am getting to work on few of the automation tasks using ansible with DellEMC arrays.
I will be putting these files here that you can use for your projects.


Thank you
Lokesh Reddy
